Hi there, I'm Harryneopotter 👋
===============================

**Just another guy** building tools that solve real problems - usually born from desperation, caffeine, and a stubborn refusal to accept that broken workflows are "just how things are."

🚀 What I Build
---------------

I create practical developer tools, AI integrations, and web applications that bridge the gap between complex technology and everyday usability. My projects focus on solving friction points that annoy me enough to fix them properly.

**Core Areas:**

*   **AI Developer Tools** - Building UIs and context management for AI coding assistants
    
*   **Accessibility-First Web Apps** - From mobile-first websites to tools for real-world constraints
    
*   **Infrastructure & DevOps** - Remote container management and deployment automation
    
*   **Context & Memory Systems** - Tools that remember so you don't have to repeat yourself
    

🛠️ Featured Projects
---------------------

[Codex-webui](https://github.com/harryneopotter/Codex-webui) ⭐ 17 stars | 6 forks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Born from: Terminal terror, internet disconnections, and a 7-hour coding marathon**

A minimal WebUI to run Codex-CLI locally with session resume and persistent memory. Features SSE streaming, auto-resume, and memory management.

**The Problem:** Terminal rendering issues turned Codex CLI output into abstract art. Internet disconnections wiped context mid-session, forcing repetitive conversations with AI.

**The Solution:** Built in desperation during a cloud server cleanup that went sideways. Seven hours later: clean web interface, session persistence, and my sanity (mostly) intact.

**Tech:** JavaScript, Node.js, SSE, JSONL parsing

[Smriti](https://github.com/harryneopotter/Smriti)
--------------------------------------------------

**Born from: "I hate repeating myself" and context-copy friction**

Lightweight project summary generator that bootstraps AI agent context. Scans codebases and creates Markdown overviews with auto-integration for Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, and other AI IDE tools.

**The Problem:** Every new AI chat tab required re-pasting project structure, file lists, and requirements. Developed a "repeat-paste twitch."

**The Solution:** Automated context generation with semantic layer (ASTs > file lists), diff tracking, and auto-init for every major AI tool. Now the tools stop asking the same questions.

**Key Innovation:** Semantic analysis extracts module exports, docstrings, and intent - not just line counts. Models answer like they actually read the code.

**Tech:** Python, AST parsing, Hash-based change detection

[telegram-cms-website-public](https://github.com/harryneopotter/telegram-cms-website-public)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Built with 💜 for accessibility, dignity, and creativity**

A minimalist, mobile-first website powered by Telegram and GCP - designed for creators who update from their phone, not a dashboard.

**The Story:** Created for a creative educator with limited mobility who needed to manage student showcase content. Instead of forcing CMS workflows, built a Telegram-based interface where all updates happen via phone messages.

**Philosophy:** "Technology should empower, not complicate" - removes friction by respecting user constraints rather than forcing adaptation.

**Tech:** TypeScript, Next.js, Telegram Bot API, GCP Cloud Functions, Firestore

[aicli](https://github.com/harryneopotter/aicli)
------------------------------------------------

**Advanced AI-powered CLI for developer productivity**

Secure, agentic command-line interface with multi-provider support (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, GLM-4). Features keychain-based API security, session encryption, and autonomous tool use.

**Key Features:**

*   Agent personas with specialized roles (Coder, Writer, etc.)
    
*   Project memory with auto-documentation (design.md, changelog.md)
    
*   Semantic code search and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
    
*   70%+ test coverage with robust security validation
    

**Tech:** TypeScript, Node.js, Keychain integration, AES-256-GCM encryption

[PlaytimeFun](https://github.com/harryneopotter/PlaytimeFun)
------------------------------------------------------------

**Built for: Family survival during holidays**

Interactive entertainment hub for kids (ages 7-11) featuring AI-generated stories in Hinglish, coloring pages, and interactive piano.

**Origin:** "How I bought 2 days of peace with React and AI" - Created to entertain niece and nephew during a holiday visit. By using their favorite characters and native language style, kept them occupied for 48 hours straight. Developer uncle coded in peace.

**Tech:** React 19, TypeScript, Google Gemini API, ElevenLabs TTS, Web Audio API

[gcp-remote-dashboard](https://github.com/harryneopotter/gcp-remote-dashboard)

🎯 Development Philosophy
-------------------------

I believe in building tools that **just work** - minimal configuration, maximum utility. My projects often start from solving my own frustrations: terminals that mangle output, context-switching hell with AI tools, or missing workflows that should exist.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Solve real friction** - Every tool has an origin story rooted in genuine pain points
    
*   **Respect constraints** - Build for real-world limitations (accessibility, mobile-first, offline considerations)
    
*   **Context is king** - Systems should remember and adapt, not force repetition
    
*   **Security by default** - Encrypted storage, keychain integration, input validation
    
*   **Document exhaustively** - Every major project includes origin stories and comprehensive docs
    

> "If a tool doesn't exist, you're either going to build it or suffer. Choose wisely."
